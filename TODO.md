# TODO

## Immediate

- Treat the current action-mode/REASON QLoRA runs as frozen negative-result baselines.
- Run constrained action-mode scoring for the 4-bit base control and normalized-reason adapter.
- Generate `reports/reconcile_v0_eval_base_vs_qlora.md` and `reports/reconcile_v0_error_table.csv`.
- Use the error table to mark clean/ambiguous/taxonomy-problem examples.
- Decide first-stage method name: `Reconcile-OPSD`, `Judgment-Delta Self-OPD`, or `Fork-Preserving Safety Distillation`.
- Keep R1/DeepSeek-R1-Distill out of first-stage experiments.
- Build the first pairwise judgment-delta data draft from audited examples.
- Redesign `continue_reasoning` as a prefix-level fork-state target, not a final response action.

## Engineering

- Add experiment config templates.
- Add a helper that exports `CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.2` for deepspeed/flash-attn runs.
- Add a training data builder for pairwise judgment-delta candidate cards.
- Add response-level generation/eval for `final_response`, eval-only for now.
- Add a classification-style or pairwise judgment-delta target option.
- Extend GPU/run helpers to write structured experiment preflight snapshots into each output directory.

## Research

- Literature scan: OPCD, OPSD, OPD for safety, safety reasoning, deliberative alignment, over-refusal, process supervision, CoT monitorability.
- Define fork/backtracking/uncertainty metrics.
- Define action-mode taxonomy.
- Design ablations.
